    	<title>Software Requirements Specification</title>
    </head>

    <h2 id="Introduction">1.Introduction</h2>
    <h3 id="Purpose">1.1	Purpose</h3>
    <p>The purpose of this document is to give a detailed description of the requirements for the “Tonatuni” It will state the purpose and complete declaration for the development of system. It will mainly describe what is required from the system in user’s terms. It will also explain system constraints, user interface and communication with other external applications. This document is primarily intended to be proposed to a customer for its approval and a reference for developing the first version of the system for the development team.</p>
    <h3 id="Document_Conventions">1.2	Document Conventions</h3>
    <ul>
    	<li>Font family: Times New Roman</li>
    	<li>Font Size: 11</li>
    	<li>Line spacing: 1.15</li>
    </ul>
    <p>We used BOLD characters to highlight many important words. We have also used bullets and numbering to enlist different ordered and unordered list.<Incomplete>
    </p>
    <h3 id="Intended_Audience">1.3	Intended Audience and Reading Suggestions</h3>
    <p>This Software Requirements document is intended for:
    <ul>
    	<li>Developers of this application who can review project and easily understand, on which features they should focus to meet the requirements (design and code the application – it sets the guidelines for future development).</li>
    	<li>Project testers:  Some bugs can be easily found using software requirement specification. This way testing becomes more organized.</li>
    	<li>Project Managers to know well the project requirements.</li>
      <li>End users of this application who want to know whether the application to be developed meet their expectations or not.</li>
    </ul>

    </p>
    <h3 id="Product_Scope">1.4	Product Scope</h3>
    <p>This system 'Tonatuni' is a dating application that allow people to meet and date over Internet. It allows users to register themselves on system’s database and create public profile. Users are shown cards of some relevant people and are allowed to chat with them
    </p>
    <p>According to a study, almost half of the youngsters aged between 18-24 look for the dates on internet. This application will provide one platform to this audience in which they can easily communicate and find their perfect match easily. It’ll provide fast and easy to understand UI and, reliable and secure platform for its users.
    </p>
    <h3 id="References">1.5	References</h3>
    <p>The Web app of the project contains a brief description of the project, screenshots, links, and tutorials and of course it gives users the ability to download and contribute to the project in different ways, since it is an open source project.</p>



    <h2 id="Overall Description"> 2. Overall Description</h2>

    <h3 id="Product Perspective"> 2.1 Product Perspective</h3>
    <p>It is a very useful app for those who are seeking for date online. Although there are some similar apps available on the internet but these are expensive to use and require costly subscriptions. It is free to use and you just have to download free app for app store or visit web app through your browser. </p>
    <h3 id="Product Functions">2.2 Product Functions</h3>
    <p>The Product will mainly provide these functions to its users:-</p>
    <h3>user:</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Register/Signup</li>
      <li>Login</li>
      <li>Displaying swipeable cards</li>
      <li>Create/Edit Profile</li>
      <li>Set Likes/Love</li>
      <li>Create matches</li>
      <li>Chat</li>

    </ul>
    <h3>Admin:</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>An admin can add , edit or delete a user account.</li>
      <li>An admin can approve or dicard a user review</li>

    </ul>
    <h3 id= "User Classes and Characteristics"> 2.3 User Classes and Characteristics</h3>
    <p>This app is for all the users especially for the people aged between 17-40. Anyone with basic computer skills and internet skill can use this app because of its easy-to-use UI.</p>
    <h3>2.4 Operating Environment</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Operating environment is as listed below.
        <p>There will be two main operating environments:-</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Web browsers</li>
          <li>Android : Must support Android 4.4 and up versions</li>
        </ul>
        </li>
    </ul>
    <h3 id= "Design and Implementation Constraints">2.5 Design and Implementation Constraints</h3>
    <p>Internet connection is required. Without an internet connection, the users cannot log in to the system. So, they cannot interact with the system without internet.</p>
    <p>Another constraint is data capacity. As we are not using our own data center, we are might face issue with capacity.</p>

    <h3 id= "User Documentation">2.6 User Documentation</h3>
    <p>User documentation components are available on the website and app's user manual portion.
    </p>


    <h2 id= "External Interface Requirements">3.External Interface Requirements</h2>
    <h3 id= "User Interfaces">3.1 User Interfaces </h3>
    <p>A user that opens the app first time should see the sign-up page with an option “I already have an account” which takes him to the login page.</p>
    <p>If user is not first-time, he/she should be able to see home page, on which there will be two tabs. A first one is profile tab, which opens by default, where he/she can change/upload profile picture, edit his/her e-mail, phone number and password. Also users can set preferred language in their profile. There will be also a chat option where user can chat to matches on 'Tonatuni' app. This tab also shows likes/loves a user has received and some other details.</p>
    <p>A second/right tab will be a search tab where user can search for dates. It includes a text bar where user can enter keywords for search and filter for search that allows user to select gender of dates to be searched. It also allows user to set preferred range of age (for example 18-22) for people to be searched. See figure for the interface for filter the mobile app (Web app filter will be similar).</p>

    <h3 id = "Hardware Interfaces">3.2 Hardware Interfaces</h3>
    <p>The mobile and web application, both do not have any specific/designated hardware, therefore it does not have any direct hardware interfaces.</p>
    <h3 id= "Software Interfaces">3.3 Software Interfaces</h3>
    <p>The mobile application uses camera application to capture photos for the profile picture and gallery/file manager application to upload pictures of user. This communication involves both reading and modification of data.</p>
    <p>It also uses default keyboard of android phone to type login/signup information and search terms and some other fields as well. This communication requires “Allow access keyboard” permission from the admin/user.</p>

    <h3 id= "Communications Interfaces">3.4 Communications Interfaces</h3>
    <p>The different parts of the systems communicate with each other in different ways and they depend on each other. However the way in which these components communicate is not important for the system (specifically not in this document). So these communications are handled by OS of both android and web app.</p>
